[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/kitchen-digitalocean.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/kitchen-digitalocean)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/test-kitchen/kitchen-digitalocean.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/test-kitchen/kitchen-digitalocean)

A Test Kitchen Driver for [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com).

Shamelessly copied from [RoboticCheese](https://github.com/RoboticCheese)'s
awesome work on an [Rackspace driver](https://github.com/RoboticCheese/kitchen-rackspace).

# Upgrading

From this version forward the driver uses [API V2](https://developers.digitalocean.com/) only.
Use of image_id, flavor_id, and region_id have been replaced with image, size, and region.
You can now use slugs instead of relying on the old data.json to translate IDs.
Please refer to the examples below, and the API documentation for more information.

# Requirements

There are no external system requirements for this driver. However you will need access to an [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/) account.

# Installation and Setup

If you're using [Chef Workstation](https://community.chef.io/tools/chef-workstation/) then kitchen-digitalocean is built-in. If not you'll need to install kitchen-digital via gem:

```bash
gem install kitchen-digitalocean
```

or add it to your Gemfile if you are using [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'kitchen-digitalocean'
```
